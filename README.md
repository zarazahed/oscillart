made for hackclub ysws oscillart

hello! this is my project wavinator, and it took me around 5hrs to make!! :>

i used javascript, html, and css to create this. here's how YOU can use it!

- click on this wonderful link: https://zarazahed.github.io/oscillart/
- follow the instructions on the website
- have a blast making your own music!!

you can contact me at zarauxz@gmail.com if you have any questions! :3

this project interested me because it really departs from the ysws that i usually participate in. plus, when i saw the gallery for oscillart, i thought it looked really neat. i was pretty curious how something like that could be made with just javascript, html, and css.

my special feature is that you can change the type of sound from sine, square, triangle, or sawtooth!
